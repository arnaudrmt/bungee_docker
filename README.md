# BungeeDocker 🚀

<br/>

**BungeeDocker** is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the rapid deployment of servers using Docker containers. It leverages the Docker Java API to create and manage containers, enabling quick server provisioning as the player base grows. With its efficient functionality, BungeeDocker serves as a crucial component in managing server infrastructure and delivering seamless gameplay experiences.

## Key Features 🌟🐳

- **Docker Container Creation**: BungeeDocker utilizes the Docker Java API to create Docker containers, enabling the quick and efficient deployment of servers. This feature ensures that servers can be provisioned within seconds, allowing players to join the game promptly.

- **Plugin Message Communication**: BungeeDocker receives plugin messages from a Spigot server via Redis. This communication mechanism facilitates the dynamic creation of containers based on player requests, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

- **Fast Server Provisioning**: From the moment a player requests a specific server to the moment they are teleported into it, BungeeDocker completes the process in less than 5 seconds. This rapid server provisioning minimizes waiting times and enhances player engagement.

- **Quality of Life Features**: BungeeDocker includes various quality of life features to streamline server management. These features include storing information about currently open servers in Redis, tracking the number of open servers, and checking for available ports to assign to new servers. These measures optimize resource utilization and ensure server availability.

- **Seamless Integration with OctanaAPI**: BungeeDocker plays a crucial role in the infrastructure by dynamically managing server instances. It receives plugin messages from OctanaAPI to open and close servers based on player demand. When a game is finished, OctanaAPI sends a Redis plugin message to BungeeDocker to shut down the server and container, effectively managing the server lifecycle.

## Usage 📝

BungeeDocker is designed to work in conjunction with the Docker Java API and Redis. By integrating these technologies, BungeeDocker offers efficient server provisioning and management. The codebase provides a comprehensive example of how to create Docker containers, handle plugin message communication, and optimize server allocation.

Please note that deploying BungeeDocker requires appropriate configuration and setup to ensure compatibility with your specific infrastructure and environment.
